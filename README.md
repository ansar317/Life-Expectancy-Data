# Life Expectancy Data Analysis with Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting life expectancy based on various factors using Multiple Linear Regression. The project utilizes a dataset comprising information about different countries and their corresponding life expectancy values. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate life expectancy based on several features.

## Project Structure

- **data/:** Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **src/:** Source code for functions and scripts used in the project.
- **results/:** Stores the results of the analysis, including visualizations and model performance metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Dataset Source](insert_dataset_source_link). It includes various features such as GDP, education, healthcare, etc., for different countries, with the target variable being life expectancy.

## Data Exploration

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and relationships between variables. Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory provide detailed data exploration.

## Data Preprocessing

Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling. Code for data preprocessing is available in the `src/preprocessing.py` file.

## Model Development

Implement Multiple Linear Regression to predict life expectancy based on selected features. The `notebooks/model_development.ipynb` notebook walks through the steps of building and training the model.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics. The `notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook showcases the model's accuracy and provides insights into its strengths and limitations.

## Results

Explore visualizations and insights derived from the analysis in the `results` directory. This includes graphs, charts, and statistical summaries.

## Dependencies

List of dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
